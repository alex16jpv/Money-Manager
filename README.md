## Models

### Accounts

Every financial journey starts with an account. Here's how we model accounts in our database:

```javascript
const accountSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    name: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    type: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      enum: ACCOUNT_TYPES,
    },
    balance: {
      type: Number,
      required: false,
    },
    user_id: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: MODEL_NAMES.USER,
      required: false,
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true, versionKey: false }
);
```

### Transactions

Transactions make the world (and your wallet) go round. Here's our transaction schema:

```javascript
const transactionSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    type: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      enum: TRANSACTION_TYPES,
    },
    amount: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
    date: {
      type: Date,
      required: true,
    },
    category: {
      type: String,
      required: false,
    },
    description: {
      type: String,
      required: false,
    },
    from_account_id: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: MODEL_NAMES.ACCOUNT,
      required: false,
    },
    to_account_id: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: MODEL_NAMES.ACCOUNT,
      required: false,
    },
    user_id: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: MODEL_NAMES.USER,
      required: false,
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true, versionKey: false }
);
```
